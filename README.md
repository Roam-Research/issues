# Roam Research Issue Tracker

Hi there fellow Roamans!

We're experimenting with a GitHub based issue tracker to channel all the awesome detailed bug reports and feature requests you all give us into a more permanent record.
Using GitHub issues will also make it easier for us to let you know when these issues are addressed, and in what release you can expect them.

You will need a GitHub account to submit issues, but making one is free and doesn't have any strings attached. When you try to open an issue GitHub will prompt you to create an account if you don't have one.


## Searching issues

Please search if your issue already exists before opening a new one. That will help us keep discussions and resolutions in one place instead of scattered around.

You can see the list of existing issues by clicking [here](https://github.com/Roam-Research/issues/issues), or in the `Issues` tab above. Use the search box above the issue list to search, and filter existing issues by label using the `Label` button. 

Sometimes the issue you're looking for is already closed and there's an answer there you can use, so be sure to check both the open and closed issues.


## Bug reports

To report a bug [click here](https://github.com/Roam-Research/issues/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) and fill in the template. We'll look at is as soon as we can.

Reproductions are really important because that's how we can determine if we fixed something. If you can find a reproduction, try to add as much detail about the context of the problem as possible.


## Feature requests

To request a new feature [click here](https://github.com/Roam-Research/issues/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature+request&template=feature_request.md&title=) and fill in the template. Please focus on the problem you're trying to solve over concrete implementations.

Keep in mind that features often require a fair bit of work and maintenance, and even if they are good ideas there are many good reasons why they might not be picked up. For instance, they might not be aligned with the overall product vision, roadmap, or are out-prioritized.


## Security issues

To report security issues [click here](https://github.com/Roam-Research/issues/security/advisories/new) and fill the template to create a [Security Advisory](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories). These are separate from public issues in that only you and the Roam team can see them, which allows us to work on fixing the problem without publicizing it further for exploitation.
